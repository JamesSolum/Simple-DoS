# Simple-DoS
Simple Denial of Service Program for a Research Project on DDoS attacks
Not very powerful but it sends a good amount of packets.  It can slow down a raspberry pi (i.e. the default attack) well enough.

Things to do:
Markup :
[ ] Get ctrl-c to stop the attack
[ ] Make packets from scratch so we can get options to spoof our IP address
[ ] Make the threading less messy
